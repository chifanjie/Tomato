# Durable Object Provider Contracts

Portable, fail-closed wire contracts for the WP5 durable-object provider boundary.

The `WP5-C09-0` slice freezes the cryptographic format foundation,
`WP5-C09-1A` adds the public provider failure boundary, `WP5-C09-1B`
freezes strict Ed25519 host conformance, and `WP5-C09-1C` closes the
structure-only bootstrap trust bundle:

- `rfc8785-jcs-safe-integer-v1` canonical JSON and exact canonical-byte parsing;
- independent branded digest, token, provider identity, and key primitives;
- host-injected SHA-256/HMAC with no Node dependency in production source;
- real domain-specific builders for installation identity, registry root key ID,
  and installation key-check token derivation;
- immutable cross-runtime golden and negative manifests;
- versioned generated JSON Schemas and packed-distribution smoke coverage.
- the single-authority `provider_unavailable` error with six ordered reasons,
  strict privacy-minimal fixtures, and a dedicated `./provider-error` export.
- an independent raw32 public-key digest that never hashes base64 text, JCS, or
  SPKI and preserves the existing domain-specific key-ID derivations;
- a browser/worker-portable strict PureEd25519 reference primitive with
  canonical, non-identity, prime-subgroup `A` and `R`, `S < L`, and the
  unbatched cofactorless verification equation;
- one immutable 28-case signed-package resource, an exact 56-point plus
  28-signature startup KAT, and a module-private opaque capability that retains
  captured method references after successful attestation.
- the fixed Bootstrap Trust Bundle Pin/Envelope/Payload, bootstrap root and
  self-signed generation-one Root Metadata, three sorted independent recovery
  keys, the literal 2-of-3 threshold, and frozen trust-history policy;
- a signed-package identity digest and distribution-root binding that pin the
  Bundle outside the five upgradeable distribution-history chains;
- one immutable cross-language bootstrap-structure crypto manifest with eight
  literal cases covering the signed-package identity, Bundle payload, Root
  Metadata, fixed-resource and deterministic root signatures, and all three
  recovery key IDs;
- immutable Installation Identity retained-origin fields and a conservative
  current versus historical-recovery classifier that never substitutes the
  current Bundle for missing or malformed retained trust.

The arbitrary domain/prefix crypto helpers are intentionally package-internal.
Consumers use the exported domain-specific builders so a caller cannot swap a
domain or output prefix.

## Verification

```sh
pnpm --filter @understand-code/durable-object-provider-contracts build
pnpm --filter @understand-code/durable-object-provider-contracts typecheck
pnpm --filter @understand-code/durable-object-provider-contracts verify:bootstrap-trust
pnpm --filter @understand-code/durable-object-provider-contracts test
pnpm --filter @understand-code/durable-object-provider-contracts test:distribution
```

The tracked manifests live under `fixtures/v1`. Expected bytes and crypto results
are literal reviewable constants; tests never generate expected values with the
implementation under test.

The separate
`fixtures/v1/golden/ed25519-public-key-digest-v1.json` keeps the original
golden manifest byte-for-byte unchanged while distributing the D-31
`00..1f` raw32 digest and the unchanged legacy root key ID to every language
consumer.

The versioned provider-error reference and invalid fixtures are checked by both
the runtime Zod contract and its generated draft-2020-12 JSON Schema. The public
error deliberately contains only `schemaVersion`, `code`, and `details.reason`.

The strict host resource is fixed at
`provider/ed25519-strict-host-conformance-v1.json`. The portable attestor chooses
that path and its 4 MiB pre-materialization cap; callers provide only a package
resource resolver, not a manifest object or alternate path. The resource is
canonical JCS, exact-covers the compiled case tuple, and must match the compiled
semantic content digest before any KAT method is called.
Packed-distribution verification executes that same 56+28 KAT from the emitted
ES2022 browser bundle with Node-only globals removed, in addition to scanning
the bundle for Node runtime dependencies.

The Bundle resource is fixed at
`provider/bootstrap-trust-bundle-v1.json`, has the compiled content digest
`sha256:a9aad99fd56ce76cf315514f258965e3d77e4da9e6a13897f42a27513a5c1cbc`,
and is byte-identical to
`fixtures/v1/golden/bootstrap-trust-bundle-v1.json`. Bundle and strict-manifest
resources each have their own 4 MiB pre-materialization limit. Verification
runs the 56+28 host KAT, then uses the resulting opaque capability for two
golden root-signature point/signature pairs, followed by exactly four
Bundle trust-key point admissions and one bootstrap self-signature
verification. The complete path therefore performs 62 point and 31 signature
calls in total.

The matching cross-language fixture is
`fixtures/v1/golden/provider-bootstrap-structure-crypto-v1.json`. It freezes
the exact JCS UTF-8 hex, SHA-256 result, key ID or raw Ed25519 signature for
five domains across eight cases. It also records the fixed Bundle file-byte
length and SHA-256 separately from semantic payload digests. The one published
seed is explicitly non-production, uses key material independent from the
Bundle root and recovery keys, and exists only to let every implementation
reproduce the same signer output. Node and browser distribution probes consume
this same file rather than copying expected constants into runtime-specific
tests.

This checked-in Bundle is deliberately a pre-release structure-conformance
fixture. Its one-time signing keys were not retained, no private key material is
distributed, and every successful public validation result is explicitly
`authority: "none_structure_only"`. It must not be treated as a production
registry authority. A future signed-package resolver, offline production key
ceremony, and crash-safe installer transaction must establish that authority
before any strong provider capability can be exposed.

## Scope boundary

This package establishes the common foundation needed by AT-C21, AT-C29,
AT-C31, and AT-Q33; it does not claim those end-to-end acceptance groups are
complete. Generic set
ordering fixtures in this slice cover only the UTF-8 bytewise foundation, not
every domain-specific comparator. Path/OID/time/producer primitives,
signed-package provenance authority, atomic Installation Identity persistence,
and full cross-language provider execution remain pending.
Later WP5 slices must add all remaining stable/digest/HMAC domains, Ed25519 signer wrappers,
provider Registry/Catalog/Taxonomy/Release Matrix contracts, provider runtime and
real-filesystem conformance, migration proofs, and the cross-language provider
implementation that consumes these same immutable manifests.
